# Important functions to remember:

"""
arrays: .push(), .append(), .remove
# is an array keeps copy, use a .copy tp freqeuntly change the subarry.
ex: adding nums from 1 to n in a list of  []
use subarry: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3]. copy the list, don't just update it

100 % 11 = 100/11's what is the remainder = 1
100 // 11 = 10, return without remiander
a ** 2 = a to the power of 2


1. range(num, -1, -1): counts backwards from num to -1 (second parameter, and since range is exclusive, it stops at 0 and doesn't reach -1), and last param step=-1 means 
    the range should decrement by -1 in each step (as opposed to increment by 1). Summary: from num to 0, backwards





1. sliding window: for when we need to find contigous, etc
2. two pointers: for when we need to store reference to 
    multiple items at once, to use the data at the same time. ex: find triple sum
3: fast and slow pointers: linked lists or cycles
